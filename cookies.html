  <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites you visit. They are generally
    used to keep websites working properly, remember preferences or collect anonymous usage data.

  <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    At the moment, <strong>chemcinoon.com</strong> is a simple static site and does not use
    first-party cookies for tracking or advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some third-party services (for example, embedded content or analytics, if added in the future)
    may set their own cookies. Those will be governed by the respective provider’s policies.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Managing Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    Most web browsers allow you to manage or delete cookies through their settings. You can usually:

    <li>View which cookies are set.</li>
    <li>Delete existing cookies.</li>
    <li>Block cookies from certain sites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Updates</h2>
  <p>
    If we add analytics, embedded tools or other cookie-based services, this policy will be updated
    to reflect the changes.
